Hi, I’m @alexia-pratensi👋
<br><br>
📜I recently did the Wagon's bootcamp in Nice where I learned the basics of programming.
<br>
I decided to learn coding following my passion💞️ for web technologies, where I can turn ideas into products.
<br>
I developed and still growing the following skills like:
<br>
- user journey, persones and needs --> map user needs and interactions to create flows and identity functionalities ;
- wireframing, mockups and prototyping --> design of wireframes, high fidelity mockups and interactive propotypes on figma ;
- front-end development (html, CSS, JS) --> Translate mockups into interactive UI ;
- database design and interactions --> design and implement databases for web applications (users, sessions, medias...) ;
- back-end development (interactions with DBs, definition of algorythms, usage of API --> definition and development of back-end functions and interactions ;
- DevOps --> fundamentals of DevOps (Git, hosting, DNS, deploy).
<br><br>

📅 In addition, in my previous life, I did a lot of project management with everything around planning, milestones, budget, team management...
<br><br>
💻I’m always interested in learning new programming languages and technics to improve my deliverables.
<br>
<br>
👀 Something about me: I’m sensitive to environment preservation 🌱 and animal protection🐮. This is why I decided to developed a first application called "Behind Meat" (👉🏻https://www.behindmeat.site/), where you can calculate the real impact of your meat consumption on the environment - in only 10 days, with 2 collegues, as part of the Wagon's bootcamp. This application is only desktop for the moment.😉  
In my free time, I like Latin dances💃, Krav Maga 🤼 and trail running in the nature 🏃.
<br>
<br>
📢 Now, I'm looking for a mission where I can contribute, grow my skills as junior full-stack web developer and work in team. 🚀
