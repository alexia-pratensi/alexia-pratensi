Hi, I’m @alexia-pratensi👋
<br><br>
Former director for several years, I am now a passionate 💞️ junior web developer, looking for exciting challenges, growth and team work.
<br>
<br>
I developed and still growing the following skills like:
<br>
- user journey, persones and needs --> map user needs and interactions to create flows and identity functionalities ;
- wireframing, mockups and prototyping --> design of wireframes, high fidelity mockups and interactive propotypes on figma ;
- front-end development (Angular, html, CSS) --> Translate mockups into interactive UI ;
- database design and interactions --> design and implement databases for web applications (users, sessions, medias...) ;
- back-end development --> Java, Spring framework, interactions with DBs, definition of algorithms, usage of API ;
- DevOps --> fundamentals of DevOps (Git, hosting, DNS, deploy).
<br><br>

📅 In addition, in my previous life, I did a lot of project management with everything around planning, milestones, budget, team management...
<br><br>
💻I’m always interested in learning new programming languages and technics to improve my deliverables.
<br>
<br>
👀 Something about me: I’m sensitive to environment preservation 🌱 and animal protection🐮. This is why I decided to developed a first application called "Behind Meat", where you can calculate the real impact of your meat consumption on the environment.  
In my free time, I like Latin dances💃, trail 🏃.
✈️I enjoy travelling all around the world 🌏
<br>
<br>
📢 Now, I'm looking for a mission where I can contribute, grow my skills as junior full-stack web developer and work in team. 🚀
